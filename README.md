Robotics Project (part 1) video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9vVbkEvUp8&ab_channel=AlfarookSaleh

Description: Building and modeling a robotic arm via MATLAB by utilizing the MATLAB Robotics Toolkit, Appdesigner, and Object-Oriented programming. Showcasing an understanding of coordinate frames, transformation matrices, DH parameters, and model optimization. 


Robotics Project (part 2) video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTAVHGAOi9w&ab_channel=AlfarookSaleh

Description: Powering up the robotic arm from part 1 and implementing a control system. Developing methods and AI to control the arm and perform certain movements to play a game of tic-tac-toe against the robot either virtually or physically.


Digital Logic Design Final Project video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9aR_W_kF-A&ab_channel=AlfarookSaleh

Description: Using the software "Vivado" to connect and develop code for the Digilent Nexys4DDR board and create a digital safe. The safe has a pre-determined code to unlock it and the user is only allowed a maximum of 3 tries before it permanently locks. The only way to try again is to manually reset the board.


MATLAB Pendulum Project (part 1) video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV6XSgt2Cnw&ab_channel=AlfarookSaleh

Description: Using MATLAB appdesigner to develop a GUI to activate an arduino and ultrasonic sensor. The GUI will record the ultrasonic sensor measuring the swing of a pendulum, display the recorded data, and use numerical methods to filter out incorrect data. The GUI can also save and load sets of data.


MATLAB Pendulum Project (part 2) video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-J1FyQOHM0&t=1s&ab_channel=AlfarookSaleh

Description: Further building upon the GUI from part 1, the GUI can now take and display the zeroes of the derivative of the data to find the swinging pendulum's period. A model of the pendulum can be derived from the length of the string used and the calculated period with matrix numerical methods such as Gauss Seidel and LU Decomposition. The gravitational constant can be approximated using the collected data and the theory of pendulums.
